Project Thunderstorm
==================

Project Thunderstorm aims to launch high altitude balloons into thunderstorms in order to collect data. Multiple balloons will be launched to take data points at different points in the thunderstorm and to use a mesh network to help deliver information throughout the thunderstorm.
